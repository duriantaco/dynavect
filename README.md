# DynaVect: Context-Aware Modulation of Global Edit Directions for Controllable GAN Editing

## Summary

Text-guided editing of generative models like StyleGAN has become a popular method for image manipulation. Current approaches face a trade-off. Optimization-based methods produce edits that are too subtle. This fails to meet the user's intent for changes. On the flip side, methods that use a single global edit vector often cause unwanted attribute entanglement and identity loss. In this work, we propose DynaVect, a hybrid approach that attempts to resolve this trade-off. Our approach is a lightweight Dynamic Contextual Modulator. The goal is to strike a balance between allowing users to make meaningful changes while still preserving the identity of the source picture.
